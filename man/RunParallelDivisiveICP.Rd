\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of \code{SingleCellExperiment} class.}

\item{batch.label}{A variable name (of class \code{character}) available 
in the cell metadata \code{colData(object)} with the batch labels (\code{character} 
or \code{factor}) to use. The variable provided must not contain \code{NAs}.
By default \code{NULL}, i.e., cells are sampled evenly regardless their batch.}

\item{k}{A positive integer greater or equal to \code{2}, denoting
the number of clusters in Iterative Clustering Projection (ICP).
Decreasing \code{k} leads to smaller cell populations diversity
and vice versa. Default is \code{8}.}

\item{d}{A numeric greater than \code{0} and smaller than \code{1} that
determines how many cells \code{n} are down- or oversampled from each cluster
into the training data (\code{n=N/k*d}), where \code{N} is the total number
of cells, \code{k} is the number of clusters in ICP. Increasing above 0.3
leads greadually to smaller cell populations diversity.
Default is \code{0.3}.}

\item{L}{A positive integer greater than \code{1} denoting the number of
the ICP runs to run. Default is \code{200}. Increasing recommended with
a significantly larger sample size (tens of thousands of cells).
Default is \code{200}.}

\item{r}{A positive integer that denotes the number of reiterations
performed until the ICP algorithm stops.
Increasing recommended with a significantly larger sample size
(tens of thousands of cells). Default is \code{5}.}

\item{C}{A positive real number denoting the cost of constraints violation in
the L1-regularized logistic regression model from the LIBLINEAR library.
Decreasing leads to more stringent feature selection, i.e. less genes are
selected that are used to build the projection classifier. Decreasing to a
very low value (~ \code{0.01}) can lead to failure to identify central cell
populations. Default \code{0.3}.}

\item{reg.type}{"L1" or "L2". L2-regularization was not
investigated in the manuscript, but it leads to a more conventional
outcome (less subpopulations). Default is "L1".}

\item{max.iter}{A positive integer that denotes
the maximum number of iterations performed until ICP stops. This parameter
is only useful in situations where ICP converges extremely slowly, preventing
the algorithm to run too long. In most cases, reaching
the number of reiterations (\code{r=5}) terminates the algorithm.
Default is \code{200}.}

\item{threads}{A positive integer that specifies how many logical processors
(threads) to use in parallel computation.
Set \code{1} to disable parallelism altogether or \code{0} to use all
available threas except one. Default is \code{0}.}

\item{icp.batch.size}{A positive integer that specifies how many cells 
to randomly select for each ICP run from the complete data set. 
This is a new feature intended to speed up the process
with larger data sets. Default is \code{Inf}, which means using all cells.}

\item{train.with.bnn}{Train data with batch nearest neighbors. Default is 
\code{TRUE}. Only used if \code{batch.label} is given.}

\item{train.k.nn}{Train data with batch nearest neighbors using \code{k} 
nearest neighbors. Default is \code{10}. Only used if \code{train.with.bnn} 
is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{train.k.nn.prop}{A numeric (higher than 0 and lower than 1) corresponding 
to the fraction of cells per cluster to use as \code{train.k.nn} nearest 
neighbors. Default is \code{NULL} meaning that the number of \code{train.k.nn} 
nearest neighbors is equal to \code{train.k.nn}. If given, \code{train.k.nn} 
parameter is ignored and \code{train.k.nn} is calculated based on 
\code{train.k.nn.prop}.}

\item{build.train.set}{Logical specifying if a training set should be built 
from the data or the whole data should be used for training. By default 
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{build.train.params}{A list of parameters to be passed to the function
\code{AggregateDataByBatch()}.}

\item{scale}{A logical specifying if data should be scaled before training. 
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{use.cluster.seed}{Should the same starting clustering result be provided
to ensure more reproducible results (logical). By default \code{FALSE}, i.e., 
Each ICP run starts with a total random and, thus, independent clustering. If 
\code{TRUE} the same clustering result is provided based on batch wise PCA 
density sampling.}

\item{divisive.method}{Divisive method (character). One of \code{"random"} 
(randomly sample two clusters out of every cluster previously found),
\code{"cluster"} or \code{"cluster.batch"} (sample two clusters out of every 
cluster previously found based on the cluster probability distribution across
batches or per batch). By default \code{"random"}.}

\item{allow.free.k}{Allow free \code{k} (logical). Allow ICP algorithm to 
decrease the \code{k} given in case it does not find \code{k} target clusters. 
By default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{ari.cutoff}{Include ICP models and probability tables with an Adjusted 
Rand Index higher than \code{ari.cutoff} (numeric). By default \code{0.5}. A
value that can range between 0 (include all) and lower than 1.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value to print verbose during the ICP run in case 
of parallelization, i.e., 'threads' different than \code{1}. Default 'FALSE'.}

\description{
This functions runs in parallel \code{L} ICP runs, which is the computational
bottleneck of ILoReg2. With ~ 3,000 cells this step should be completed
in ~ 2 h and ~ 1 h with 3 and 12 logical processors (threads), respectively.
